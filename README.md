# SpyCamTelegramBot
A simple python script that takes you a photo and sends it privately each 10 seconds (you can modify the time lapse)

## Why do i do this?
I was just bored and i wanted to mix telegram bots with opencv library. It was the easy way.

## How can you use it?
Just modify the autoshortcut.py giving it the token and, if you want, a number of conversation

## FINAL NOTE
I am not responsible for the use of this script
